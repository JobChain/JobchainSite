        <p>This site shows co-op data of a random sample of University of Waterloo students. The data was taken from LinkedIn, and only includes students in the realm of software with 2 or more experiences. Stay tuned for improvements.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the old UW co-op stats V2 found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150904163656/http://vlyubin.pythonanywhere.com:80/students">here</a>, we decided to create an updated and sortable version.</p>
        <p>We hope this site can help you choose your next internship.</p>
        <p>Add your linkedin ID in the comments section to have your co-op sequence added!</p>
