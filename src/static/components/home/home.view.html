        <p>This site shows co-op data of a random sample of University of Waterloo students. The data was taken from LinkedIn, and includes all UW students for now... stay tuned for improvements.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the old UW co-op stats V2 found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150904163656/http://vlyubin.pythonanywhere.com:80/students">here</a></p>
        <p>We hope this site can help you choose your next internship, especially for those like us who don't have the luxury of using WaterlooWorks!</p>
